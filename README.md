## Abstract

Today’s newspapers have the power to shape one’s entire perspective on the world.  For that reason, itis very important to be able to differentiate between newspapers that keep one in a rather pessimisticstate of being, or newspapers that offer a more optimistic outlook on the world.  The idea is to create,train, adjust and improve a model so that it is fit to analyze various Swiss newspapers and todetermine which papers are written with the most negative and positive attitude.
